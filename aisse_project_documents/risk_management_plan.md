  project_name: "MedAssist AI: Primary Care Diagnostic Support System"
  risk_assessment_date: "2024-03-18"
```

## Risk Thresholds Applied

**Base Risk Appetite:** Conservative (Option A)
- **Green Zone:** 5-9 (Monitor only)
- **Yellow Zone:** 10-18 (Take action to reduce)
- **Red Zone:** 19-45 (Must fix before proceeding)

**Adjustments Applied:**
- **Stage Scaling:** Concept stage (× 0.7) - Higher risk acceptable with no real users yet
- **Familiarity Scaling:** Applied (Known ×1.0, Foreseeable ×1.2, Emergent ×1.4)

## Priority Risk Register

### Red Zone Risks (Must Address Immediately)

#### Risk: Misdiagnosis Leading to Patient Harm
- **Risk Score:** 32 (Impact: 5, Likelihood: 3, Formula: 2×(5+3)+(5×3) = 31)
- **Insight Level:** Foreseeable (×1.2) = 37.2
- **Current Stage Adjusted:** 37.2 × 0.7 = 26.0 → **RED ZONE**
- **Mitigation Actions:**
  - Implement confidence thresholds - no suggestions below 70% confidence
  - Require explicit GP confirmation for all high-risk diagnoses
  - Build in second-opinion triggers for critical conditions
  - Comprehensive clinical validation testing before pilot
- **Owner:** Dr Sarah Chen, Clinical Lead
- **Review Frequency:** Weekly during development, daily during pilot
- **Target:** Reduce to Yellow Zone before pilot deployment

#### Risk: Over-reliance on AI Recommendations
- **Risk Score:** 24 (Impact: 4, Likelihood: 3, Formula: 2×(4+3)+(4×3) = 26)
- **Insight Level:** Foreseeable (×1.2) = 31.2
- **Current Stage Adjusted:** 31.2 × 0.7 = 21.8 → **RED ZONE**
- **Mitigation Actions:**
  - Mandatory clinical reasoning documentation when following AI suggestions
  - Regular training on maintaining clinical independence
  - Built-in prompts encouraging clinical judgement
  - Audit trail of AI vs human decision patterns
- **Owner:** Clinical Training Team
- **Review Frequency:** Bi-weekly
- **Target:** Reduce to Yellow Zone through training and interface design

### Yellow Zone Risks (Actively Mitigate)

#### Risk: Bias in Diagnostic Suggestions
- **Risk Score:** 20 (Impact: 4, Likelihood: 2, Formula: 2×(4+2)+(4×2) = 20)
- **Insight Level:** Known (×1.0) = 20
- **Current Stage Adjusted:** 20 × 0.7 = 14.0 → **YELLOW ZONE**
- **Mitigation Actions:**
  - Diverse training data including underrepresented groups
  - Regular bias testing across demographic categories
  - Clinical review board with diversity expertise
  - Ongoing monitoring of diagnostic patterns by demographics
- **Owner:** Data Science Team + Clinical Ethics Board
- **Review Frequency:** Monthly bias audits
- **Target:** Maintain in Green Zone through proactive monitoring

#### Risk: Data Breach of Patient Records
- **Risk Score:** 25 (Impact: 5, Likelihood: 1, Formula: 2×(5+1)+(5×1) = 17)
- **Insight Level:** Known (×1.0) = 17
- **Current Stage Adjusted:** 17 × 0.7 = 11.9 → **YELLOW ZONE**
- **Mitigation Actions:**
  - End-to-end encryption for all patient data
  - NHS-approved cloud infrastructure only
  - Regular penetration testing
  - Staff security training and access controls
- **Owner:** Information Security Team
- **Review Frequency:** Quarterly security audits
- **Target:** Maintain strong controls to prevent escalation

### Green Zone Risks (Monitor)

#### Risk: System Downtime During Consultations
- **Risk Score:** 12 (Impact: 3, Likelihood: 2, Formula: 2×(3+2)+(3×2) = 16)
- **Insight Level:** Known (×1.0) = 12
- **Current Stage Adjusted:** 12 × 0.7 = 8.4 → **GREEN ZONE**
- **Mitigation Actions:**
  - Redundant system architecture
  - Clear fallback procedures for manual operation
  - Regular system health monitoring
- **Owner:** Technical Operations Team
- **Review Frequency:** Monthly uptime reports
- **Target:** Maintain >99.5% availability

#### Risk: Resistance from Clinical Staff
- **Risk Score:** 14 (Impact: 2, Likelihood: 3, Formula: 2×(2+3)+(2×3) = 16)
- **Insight Level:** Known (×1.0) = 14
- **Current Stage Adjusted:** 14 × 0.7 = 9.8 → **GREEN ZONE**
- **Mitigation Actions:**
  - Early engagement with clinical champions
  - User-centred design process
  - Comprehensive training programme
  - Feedback loops for continuous improvement
- **Owner:** Change Management Team
- **Review Frequency:** Monthly stakeholder feedback
- **Target:** Achieve >90% user satisfaction before full deployment

## Risk Response Procedures

### Red Zone Response Protocol
1. **Immediate escalation** to Clinical Advisory Board
2. **Development pause** until mitigation implemented
3. **Daily monitoring** until risk reduced to Yellow Zone
4. **Executive sign-off** required before proceeding
5. **External clinical review** if risk persists >2 weeks

### Yellow Zone Response Protocol
1. **Active mitigation** measures implemented within 1 week
2. **Bi-weekly progress reviews** with risk owners
3. **Additional controls** added if risk shows upward trend
4. **Stakeholder communication** about mitigation progress

### Green Zone Response Protocol
1. **Regular monitoring** as per schedule
2. **Quarterly risk assessment** to check for changes
3. **Proactive maintenance** of existing controls
4. **Early warning system** for risk escalation indicators

## Risk Governance

**Risk Review Board:** Clinical Advisory Board + Technical Leadership
**Meeting Frequency:** Weekly during development, monthly during operations
**Escalation Path:** Clinical Lead → Medical Director → NHS Trust Board
**Documentation:** All risk decisions logged in clinical governance system

**External Oversight:**
- MHRA regulatory compliance review
- NHS Digital security assessment
- Clinical effectiveness evaluation by independent experts
