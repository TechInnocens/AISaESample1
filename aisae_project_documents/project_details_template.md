**Project Description**
- AI-powered content moderation for online platforms
- Multi-modal analysis (text, images, video)
- Focus on reducing harm while preserving legitimate expression
- Transparent and explainable moderation decisions

### Context

**Purpose**
The system helps online platforms maintain safer communities by automatically detecting harmful content including hate speech, harassment, doxxing, and spam. It provides confidence scores and explanations to support human moderators in making final decisions.

**Environment**
The system operates in high-stakes online environments where moderation decisions can significantly impact user experience, platform reputation, and potentially user safety. False positives can harm legitimate expression while false negatives can allow harmful content to spread.

**Stakeholders**
- Platform users (content creators and consumers)
- Platform moderators and safety teams
- Platform executives and legal teams
- Advertisers and business partners
- Regulatory bodies and civil society organizations
- Vulnerable communities who may be targets of harmful content

## Categorisation of use-case

**Purpose/Role** *(What role does this AI play in users' lives?)*
Select ALL that apply:
<!--%PURPOSE_CODES-->
- [ ] **Creates (C)** - Makes things for users (content creation, synthesis)
- [x] **Decides (D)** - Chooses for users (decision making, recommendations)
- [x] **Finds (F)** - Finds things for users (identification, discovery, information retrieval)
- [ ] **Predicts (P)** - Tells users what's coming (prediction, monitoring)
- [ ] **Helps (H)** - Helps users do things (digital assistance, performance improvement)
- [ ] **Acts (A)** - Takes actions for users (process automation, robotic automation)
- [ ] **Multiple (M)** - System performs multiple roles at different times or upon request
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The purpose or role of this system is not known or decided

**Environment** *(In what context is the system operating?)*
Select ONE (or ? for unknown):
<!--%ENVIRONMENT_CODE-->
- [ ] **Low-stakes (L)** - Entertainment, convenience, internal tools
- [ ] **Social-facing (S)** - Public interaction, reputation, relationships
- [x] **High-stakes (H)** - Safety, health, finance, legal decisions, well-being affecting
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The environment for the use-case is not known or decided

## Categorisation of System Design Forces

**Control Relationship** *(What's the human-system control dynamic?)*
Select ONE (or ? for unknown):
<!--%CONTROL_CODE-->
- [ ] **Human-Controlled (C)** - Supervised autonomy + Static modification + Transactional interaction
- [x] **Human-Guided (G)** - Monitored autonomy + Adaptive/agentic + Stateful interaction
- [ ] **System-Independence (I)** - Independent/Agent autonomy + Self-modifying + Persistent operation
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The control relationship is not known or decided

**Capability Level** (What's the sophistication and power of the underlying system?)
Select ONE (or ? for unknown):
<!--%CAPABILITY_CODE-->
- [ ] **Basic (B)** - Simple algorithms, narrow processing (rule-based, basic ML)
- [x] **Advanced (A)** - Sophisticated models with reasoning (LLMs, multimodal models, complex ML)
- [ ] **Emergent (E)** - Systems with unexpected or hard-to-predict capabilities
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The capability level of the system is not known or decided
